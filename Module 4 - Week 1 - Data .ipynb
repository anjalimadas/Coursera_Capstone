This information can be really helpful to tourists since they can focus on what they are trying to experience most during their Travel .(Food, culture, sport etc) These techniques also provides the visualization of clustering of city. k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells"
